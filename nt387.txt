I have never designed a CLI-game before this assignment, so it was truly a novel
puzzle to solve; trying to code in the various rules and restrictions of the
game in a modular, compartmentalized manner was a surprisingly arduous task. It
was interesting to see how our UML diagram changed from the initial diagram we
had constructed to the final one we settled on after working on the problem set.
I realized that peer programming can often lead to messy code once we merge and
combine our efforts, but if we communicate effectively and let each other know
at all times what files weâ€™re working on and when to push and pull via Git,
version control becomes an easy fix. It also made me appreciate comments on code
significantly as sometimes, due to a narrow timeframe, it was not always
possible to read through every single line and it was easy to simply know the
purpose of various methods and to utilize them as necessary.
