The assignment was a challenge in terms of the time commitment compared to
previous assignments, but I absolutely enjoyed figuring out the nooks and
crannies of factoring in the logic of the game. My appreciation for UML diagrams
have skyrocketed as this was the first time in this class that we did not have a
predesigned structure or layout of the code given to us. The UML class diagram
helped me to have a deeper understanding of the relationships between various
objects within a software engineering project and made me reconsider my ideas of
correlation, causation, ownership and identity in the context of object-oriented
design principles. Peer programming was also interesting; task delegation seemed
straightforward initially, but we were quick to realize that there were parts of
code that we did not understand due to a dynamically shifting understanding of
the classes themselves. It made me value communication with my partner
significantly and increased my appreciation for Git for robust version control.
